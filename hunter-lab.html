<p>Hunter Lab Anti-Aging Elixir is a blend of lightweight, nourishing and hydrating base oils, with caffeine, carrageenan, and antioxidants to soothe and protect the skin from aging. The caffeine helps tighten the skin and stimulate blood flow to the surface. This reduces wrinkles and smooths the surface. The potent antioxidant value of the passion fruit seed extract helps eliminate the oxidative damage that leads to the signs of aging.</p>

<p>This anti-aging elixir makes for a perfect addition to a good skin care regime to reduce the side effects aging has on the skin.</p>
